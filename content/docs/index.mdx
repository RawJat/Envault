# Welcome to Envault

**Envault** is an open-source, self-hostable secret management platform designed for modern development teams. It simplifies the chaos of managing `.env` files across multiple projects, environments, and team members, ensuring your sensitive data is **always encrypted** and **always syncronized**.

<Callout title="Why Envault?">
  Traditional secret management often involves insecurely sharing `.env` files over Slack or using expensive, enterprise-only SaaS solutions. Envault bridges the gap: **Bank-grade security** with a **developer-first experience**, completely under your control.

## Core Features

Envault isn't just a database for strings. It's a complete ecosystem for secret lifecycle management.

### Security First
Security isn't an afterthought; it's the foundation.
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Utilizing a robust envelope encryption strategy.
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Secrets are decrypted only in memory when requested.
- **Automatic Key Rotation**: Rotate keys seamlessly without downtime.

### Developer Experience
Built to fit into your existing workflow, not disrupt it.
- **Unified CLI**: `envault pull` is all you need to sync secrets.
- **Project Workspaces**: Isolate secrets by project (e.g., `web-app`, `backend-api`).
- **Team Collaboration**: Granular permissions (Owner, Editor, Viewer) for every member.

### Performance & Design
- **Modern UI**: A stunning, responsive dashboard built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Shadcn UI**.
- **Interactive Visuals**: Experience 3D elements powered by **React Three Fiber**.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Move through your secrets as fast as you type.

## How it Works

At a high level, Envault acts as the single source of truth for your environment variables.

1.  **Push**: Developers push encrypted secrets to a central project.
2.  **Manage**: Owners control access using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
3.  **Pull**: Apps and developers pull secrets into their local environments or CI/CD pipelines securely.
