# Envault CLI

The Envault CLI is the primary way developers interact with secrets in their daily workflow. It allows you to push and pull secrets without leaving your terminal.

## Installation

### Universal Script (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Envault on macOS and Linux.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DinanathDash/Envault/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Homebrew (macOS & Linux)

If you use Homebrew, you can install Envault via our official tap.

```bash
brew tap DinanathDash/envault
brew install envault
```

### JS Package Managers

Envault is available as an NPM package, allowing you to use it with any Node.js package manager.

<Tabs items={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun"]}>
  <Tab value="npm">```bash npm install -g @dinanathdash/envault ```</Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">```bash pnpm add -g @dinanathdash/envault ```</Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">```bash yarn global add @dinanathdash/envault ```</Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">```bash bun add -g @dinanathdash/envault ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

Or run instantly via `npx`:

```bash
npx @dinanathdash/envault <command>
```

### Go Developers

If you have Go installed, you can install the CLI directly from source.

```bash
go install github.com/DinanathDash/Envault/cli-go@latest
```

### Manual Installation

## Workflow

The typical developer workflow looks like this:

1. **Login**: Authenticate your machine.
2. **Init**: Link a folder to an Envault project.
3. **Pull**: Get the latest secrets.
4. **Dev**: Work on your code.
5. **Push**: Upload new secrets if you added any.

See the [Commands Reference](/docs/cli/commands) for details on each command.

## Automatic Updates

The Envault CLI features a built-in, non-blocking update checker. It querys the registry for the latest release in the background so it never slows down your workflow. If an update is available, you will receive a clean notification at the bottom of your output instructing you on how to update based on your specific package manager.

## Environment Variables

The Envault CLI uses the following environment variables for configuration:

| Variable              | Description                          | Default                        |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| `ENVAULT_API_URL`     | The URL of the Envault API server.   | `https://envault.tech/api/cli` |
| `ENVAULT_CONFIG_FILE` | Path to a custom configuration file. | `~/.envault.yaml`              |

### Using Local Instance

To test against a local instance of Envault:

```bash
export ENVAULT_API_URL="http://localhost:3000/api/cli"
envault login
```
