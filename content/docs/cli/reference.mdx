# Envault CLI

The Envault CLI is the primary way developers interact with secrets in their daily workflow. It allows you to push and pull secrets without leaving your terminal.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @dinanathdash/envault
```

Or run via `npx`:

```bash
npx @dinanathdash/envault <command>
```

## Workflow

The typical developer workflow looks like this:

1. **Login**: Authenticate your machine.
2. **Init**: Link a folder to an Envault project.
3. **Pull**: Get the latest secrets.
4. **Dev**: Work on your code.
5. **Push**: Upload new secrets if you added any.

See the [Commands Reference](/docs/cli/commands) for details on each command.
