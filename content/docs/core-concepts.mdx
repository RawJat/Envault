# Core Concepts

Everything you need to know about Envaults architecture.

## Security Architecture

Envault uses a hybrid encryption model to ensure maximum security.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="1. Master Key">
A **32-byte key** stored in environment variables (`ENCRYPTION_KEY`). This key is used **solely** to encrypt and decrypt Data Keys. It never leaves the server environment and is never stored in the database.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="2. Data Keys">
Unique keys generated for encrypting actual secret data. These keys are stored **encrypted** in the database. When the application needs to decrypt a secret, it first decrypts the Data Key using the Master Key, then uses the Data Key to decrypt the secret.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="3. Key Rotation">
Data keys can be rotated. This limits the amount of data encrypted with a single key. The active key is cached in **Redis** for high performance without compromising security by repeatedly accessing the database encryption keys.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="4. AES-256-GCM">
All secrets are encrypted using **AES-256-GCM** (Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/Counter Mode). This provides both confidentiality (encryption) and authenticity (integrity checks), ensuring that data has not been tampered with.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Project Structure

Envault organizes secrets into **Projects**. Each project acts as a secure container for environment variables.

- **Workspaces**: Organize multiple projects.
- **Roles**:
    - **Owner**: Full access to project settings, secrets, and member management.
    - **Editor**: Can read and write secrets.
    - **Viewer**: Read-only access to secrets.
