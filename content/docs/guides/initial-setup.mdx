import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

After installing the dependencies, you need to configure the core services.

## Database Setup (Supabase)

Envault relies on Supabase for authentication and database storage.

1. Create a new project in the [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard).
2. Go to **Project Settings > API** and copy your:
   - Project URL
   - `anon` public key
   - `service_role` secret key (keep this safe!)

Update your `.env.local` file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key
```

## Encryption Keys

Envault uses a master key to encrypt the database keys. This is critical for security.

<Callout type="warn" title="Critical Security Warning">
  You must generate a strong random string for your `ENCRYPTION_KEY`. If you
  lose this key, **all data encrypted with it will be irretrievable.**
</Callout>

Generate a secure key (e.g., using openssl):

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Add this to your `.env.local`:

```bash
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_generated_hex_key
```

## Running the Development Server

Now you are ready to start the application.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Email Configuration (Optional)

Envault uses [Resend](https://resend.com) to send emails for invites and notifications.

1. Sign up for a Resend account and create an API Key.
2. Add your key to `.env.local`:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
```

You can verify that your email configuration works by sending a test email:

```bash
npm run test:email -- your-email@example.com
```
