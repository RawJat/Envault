Envault is a self-hostable application. You can run it locally or deploy it to your own infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js 18+** (LTS recommended)
- **Supabase** project (or a local Supabase instance)
- **Redis** (optional, for caching)

## Quick Start

<Steps>
<Step>
 
### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dinanathdash/envault.git
cd envault
```

</Step>
<Step>
 
### Install dependencies

We recommend using `pnpm` for faster installation, but `npm` or `yarn` work just as well.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash
  pnpm install
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  ```bash
  yarn install
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
  ```bash
  bun install
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>
<Step>
 
### Environment Setup

Copy the example environment file to get started.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

You will need to populate `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Once installed, proceed to the [Initial Setup](/docs/guides/initial-setup) guide to configure your database and encryption keys.
