Envault allows you to control who has access to which projects using a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system.

## Roles

There are three primary roles available in Envault.

| Role       | Description                                                            | Best For                          |
| :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| **Owner**  | Full admin access. Can delete projects, manage users, and rotate keys. | Check Tech Leads, DevOps.         |
| **Editor** | Can read, create, update, and delete secrets. Cannot manage users.     | Backend Developers.               |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to secrets.                                           | Frontend Developers, Contractors. |

### Owner

The **Owner** has the keys to the castle.

- **Manage Members**: Invite or remove users from the project, and approve/deny share requests initiated by Editors.
- **Delete Project**: Permanently remove the project and all its secrets.
- **Rotate Keys**: Perform cryptographic key rotation.
- **Billing**: Manage subscription (if applicable).

### Editor

The **Editor** is the standard role for day-to-day development.

- **Manage Secrets**: Add new environment variables or update existing ones.
- **Manage Environments**: Create new environments (e.g., `feature-branch-1`).
- **View Audit Logs**: See who changed what.

<Callout type="info">
  Editors can initiate **Share** requests to temporarily invite new members to
  the project, but these require **Owner** approval before the new user gains
  access.
</Callout>

### Viewer

The **Viewer** role is strictly read-only.

- **View Secrets**: See values in the dashboard.
- **Pull Secrets**: Use `envault pull` to get secrets locally.
- **Cannot Edit**: Any attempt to write will result in a `403 Forbidden` error.

## Granular Permissions

Currently, permissions are scoped to the **Project** level.

> **Roadmap Item**: We are working on Environment-level permissions (e.g., a user is an _Editor_ in `Development` but only a _Viewer_ in `Production`).

## Governance & Auditing

Every action taken by a user is logged. Owners can view the **Audit Log** in the project settings to see:

- Who accessed a secret.
- Who changed a value.
- Timestamps and IP addresses.

## Just-in-Time (JIT) Access via GitHub

When a project is linked to a GitHub repository, Envault can automatically grant **Viewer** access to developers the moment they run `envault pull` - no manual invite needed.

**How it works:**
1. A developer runs `envault pull` without an existing project membership.
2. Envault checks if their GitHub account is a collaborator on the linked repository.
3. If yes → they are auto-granted the `viewer` role and receive their secrets.
4. If no → the CLI offers to submit an access request to the project owner.

See the [GitHub Integration](/docs/guides/github-integration) guide for setup instructions.
