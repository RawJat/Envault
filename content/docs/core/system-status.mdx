description: Real-time monitoring of system health and incident reporting.

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

Envault includes a built-in system status layer that provides real-time transparency into application health. It covers a dedicated status page, an in-app banner that surfaces active incidents, a public API endpoint, and a footer badge - all driven from the same data source.

## Status page

The status page is accessible at `/status` and shows:

- **Overall system health** - a single top-level indicator derived from the worst active component or incident
- **Component status** - granular health for individual services (API, Database, Authentication, etc.)
- **Active incidents** - severity, current phase, and a live update timeline
- **Incident history** - resolved incidents from the last 90 days

## Status levels

All status indicators across the app share the same four levels:

| Level | Colour | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operational** | Emerald | Everything is running normally |
| **Degraded** | Amber | Some services are impacted or slow |
| **Outage** | Red | One or more services are unavailable |
| **Maintenance** | Blue | Scheduled maintenance is in progress |

The overall level is computed as the **worst** of all active component statuses and incident severities, so the banner and status page always agree.

## In-app status banner

When the system is not fully operational, a dismissible banner appears at the top of every app page. It shows the incident message, severity level, and a direct link to the status page.

- The banner is hidden when all systems are operational
- Dismissing it stores the state in `sessionStorage` - it won't reappear during the same browser session but will show again after a hard refresh
- The banner is fully responsive: on small screens the secondary text is replaced with a compact "View status" link

## Incident severities

Incidents are created with one of four severities, which map to the visual status level shown across the app:

| Severity | Maps to level | When to use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Minor** | Maintenance (blue) | Small degradation, minimal user impact |
| **Major** | Degraded (amber) | Noticeable disruption to some features |
| **Critical** | Outage (red) | Service is down or broadly unavailable |
| **Maintenance** | Maintenance (blue) | Planned maintenance window |

## Incident phases

Each incident progresses through phases. The timeline on the status page uses distinct icons and colours per phase:

| Phase | Colour | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Investigating** | Red | Issue identified, root cause unknown |
| **Identified** | Amber | Root cause found, fix in progress |
| **Monitoring** | Blue | Fix deployed, watching for stability |
| **Resolved** | Emerald | Incident fully resolved |

## Public API

The current system status is available without authentication:

```http
GET /api/system-status
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "level": "degraded",
  "message": "We are investigating elevated API error rates.",
  "incidentCount": 1
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `level` | `"operational" \| "degraded" \| "outage" \| "maintenance"` | Worst current status level |
| `message` | `string \| null` | Active incident message, or `null` if fully operational |
| `incidentCount` | `number` | Number of currently active (unresolved) incidents |

<Callout type="info">
  Responses are cached for 60 seconds via Redis. This endpoint is safe to poll from external monitoring tools or status widgets without impacting the database.
</Callout>

## Administrative controls

Administrators can manage system status from the admin dashboard:

- Create and update incidents with severity and phase
- Post timeline updates as an incident progresses
- Manually override the status of individual components
- Schedule and close maintenance windows
