Envault includes a built-in System Status page that provides real-time transparency into the health of the application's components. This feature allows users to verify if the system is operational, check for active incidents, and review historical uptime.

## Overview

The System Status page is accessible at `/status`. It provides a comprehensive view of:

-   **Overall System Health**: A global indicator of the system's current state.
-   **Active Incidents**: Real-time updates on any ongoing issues, including severity and status.
-   **Component Status**: Granular health checks for individual system components (e.g., API, Database, Authentication).
-   **Past Incidents**: A history of resolved incidents over the last 90 days.

## Status Indicators

The system uses color-coded indicators to communicate the health of each component:

-   <span className="text-emerald-500 font-bold">Operational</span>: The component is functioning normally.
-   <span className="text-amber-500 font-bold">Degraded Performance</span>: The component is operational but experiencing latency or minor issues.
-   <span className="text-red-500 font-bold">Partial/Major Outage</span>: The component is currently unavailable or severely impacted.
-   <span className="text-blue-500 font-bold">Maintenance</span>: The component is undergoing scheduled maintenance.

## Incident Reporting

When an incident occurs, the status page displays detailed information, including:

1.  **Severity**: Classified as **Minor**, **Major**, or **Critical**.
2.  **Status**: The current state of the incident (e.g., **Investigating**, **Identified**, **Monitoring**, **Resolved**).
3.  **Updates**: A timeline of updates provided by the team as they work to resolve the issue.

Users can subscribe to updates (if configured) or simply refresh the page to see the latest information.

## Administrative Controls

Administrators can manage the system status via the admin dashboard. This includes:

-   Creating and updating incidents.
-   Manually overriding the status of individual components.
-   Scheduling maintenance windows.
