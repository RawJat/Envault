# Project Structure

Envault organizes secrets into **Projects**. Each project typically corresponds to a specific application or service (e.g., "Main Website", "Backend API", "IOS App").
Projects are cleanly structured via **semantic routing** (e.g., `/[username]/[project-slug]`), allowing for global uniqueness and easy navigation between owned and shared projects.

## Hierarchy

<Mermaid

    ProjectA -->|Contains| SecretsA[Secrets]
    ProjectB -->|Contains| SecretsB[Secrets]
`}
/>

## Roles and Permissions

Envault implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system.
