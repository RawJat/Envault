## 1.4.0 — 2026-03-17

> Authors: Dinanath Dash (DinanathDash), Rajat Patra (RawJat)

### Features

- **Server-First Architecture:** Migrated Envault to a strict Next.js Server Component architecture. Completely removed `"use client"` directives from page and layout files, drastically reducing the client-side JavaScript bundle size and mitigating the "white screen" issue on slow connections.
- **Deep Folder Restructuring:** Consolidated and reorganized `src/lib` and `src/components` into domains (`/auth`, `/infra`, `/system`, `/dialogs`, etc.) to improve project maintainability and strict separation of concerns.
- **Animation Restoration & Client Isolation:** Restored beautiful `framer-motion` animations across the landing page using strictly isolated Client Component wrappers (`FadeIn.tsx` and `SlideUp.tsx`), ensuring full SSR compatibility.
- **Throttled Window Focus Refresher:** Implemented a lightweight, throttled window-focus refetching strategy to sync the web UI with CLI actions without exhausting database or Redis limits.

### Improvements

- **Account Deletion Data Preservation:** Shared secrets are now preserved during account deletion and reassigned safely to the project owner instead of being removed.
- **Identity Continuity After Member Exit:** Secret records now retain creator/updater identity snapshots so audit logs and variable tables remain attributable even after a user account is deleted.
- **Audit Logs Filtering & UX:** Enhanced audit logs interface with improved filtering capabilities, better detail semantics, and improved fallback handling for edge cases.
- **Audit Event Taxonomy & Privacy:** Enforced structured event taxonomy with privacy-aware access controls and member-level access policies for audit log visibility.
- **Secret Share Management:** Editors can now manage secret shares directly, improving workflow efficiency for environment access requests.
- **Approval + Access Consistency:** Fixed role assignment during share-request approval so the selected role is applied correctly, with environment access handling aligned for simple and advanced project modes.
- **Project Activity Freshness:** Project dashboard cards now track latest project activity updates from editor/owner secret mutations, with broader cache invalidation to reduce stale timestamps.
- **CLI & Release Workflow Reliability:** Updated publish workflow gating to release when CLI files changed since the last CLI tag, added missing `conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits` dependency, fixed CLI wrapper metadata, modernized GoReleaser keys, and regenerated lockfile state.

- **Core Application Scaffold:** Bootstrapped with Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI component library.
- **User Authentication:** Full email/password authentication powered by Supabase Auth, including signup, login, and session management via SSR-compatible cookies.
- **Project Management:** Users can create, view, and delete projects — organisational units for grouping related environment variables.
- **Environment Variable Vault:** Core secret storage with AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption. Each secret is encrypted with a project-scoped Data Key before being persisted to the database.
- **Bulk `.env` Import:** Paste or upload a raw `.env` file and Envault parses, encrypts, and stores all key-value pairs in a single operation.
- **UI Component Library:** Established the full Shadcn/Radix UI component foundation: `Button`, `Dialog`, `Input`, `Card`, `Badge`, `DropdownMenu`, `Avatar`, and more.
- **Async Secret Decryption:** Secrets are decrypted on-demand in the browser — plaintext values are never persisted to the client beyond the active session.
- **User Sign-Out:** Secure server-side sign-out with session invalidation and redirect to the login page.
